      <h4>
        RockyStepsWay, its founders, and leaders are NOT responsible for any injury, including death, to
        any person participating in RockyStepsWay workouts.<br>
        In consideration of my acceptance and my participation in RockyStepsWay workouts, I hereby
        release and covenant not to sue RockyStepsWay or its founders, for any and all present and
        future claims resulting from ordinary negligence and inherent risk during RockyStepsWay
        workouts, including but not limited to, any loss, injury, damage, or liability sustained by me.
      </h4>
      <h4 class="mt-3">
        I understand that the reaction of the heart, lung, and blood vessel system to exercise cannot
        always be predicted with accuracy. I know and understand there is a risk of certain abnormal
        changes which may occur during or following exercise, including, but not limited to, abnormalities
        of blood pressure and heart attacks. Performance of exercises may lead to muscle-skeletal
        strains, pain, and/or injury, if adequate warm-up, gradual progression, and safety procedures are
        not followed. I understand that RockyStepsWay shall not be liable for any damages arising from
        personal injuries sustained by me while participating in and during participation of the
        RockyStepsWay workouts. I understand and warrant, release and agree that I am in good physical
        condition and that I have no disabilities, impairments, or ailments that would prevent me from
        engaging in active or passive exercise that could be detrimental or inimical to heart, safety,
        and/or comfort or physical condition while I engage or participate in RockyStepsWay exercises. I
        have had a recent physical check-up and have a medical physician’s permission to
        engage in aerobic and/or anaerobic activities. I hereby agree to release, discharge and hold
        harmless RockyStepsWay, its founders, and location leaders, from all causes, liabilities, damages,
        claims, or demands whatsoever on account of any injury or accident involving myself arising out
        of my participation in RockyStepsWay workouts.
      </h4>
      <h4 class="mt-3">
        I acknowledge that physical exercise can be dangerous and involve the risk of serious injury,
        paralysis, and/or death. I hereby acknowledge and agree to assume responsibility for all the risks, 
        whether identified herein or not, even those risks arising out of the negligence of the releasee. My
        participation is purely voluntary. I assume full responsibility for myself for any bodily injury.
